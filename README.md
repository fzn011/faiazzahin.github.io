## Projects
### LMS (Learning Management System)

The Learning-Website project is a web-based educational platform built using Laravel with PHP, JavaScript, Blade templates, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for a modern and responsive UI. The repository follows a typical Laravel MVC structure, including routing, templating, asset management, and database integration. While the README mainly contains Laravelâ€™s default setup instructions, the project appears to be designed for hosting and managing learning content, suggesting features like user authentication, course listings, and an interactive interface.

The project designs a Password Protection System using XOR, AND, and NOT gates. It compares a 4-bit key code with user input; if they match, a green LED lights up, and if not, a red LED shows. This system demonstrates how digital logic gates can be used for security by validating passwords.
