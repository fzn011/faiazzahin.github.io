## Projects
### Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict **cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)** from a **Kaggle dataset** of **70,000 records** with **13 health features**. **Random Forest** performed best (**98% training**, **71% testing**), while **Logistic Regression** and **MLP** achieved **\~72â€“73% accuracy**. It demonstrates the potential of machine learning for **early detection** and **risk prediction** of heart diseases.
