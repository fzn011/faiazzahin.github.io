### Password Protection System 

[Password Protection System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zQAG-bZvKv7j8okOovvjWUiQjUB8WUMX)

The project designs a Password Protection System using XOR, AND, and NOT gates. It compares a 4-bit key code with user input; if they match, a green LED lights up, and if not, a red LED shows. This system demonstrates how digital logic gates can be used for security by validating passwords.

###  Predicting Coronary Artery disease with Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron and Logistic Regression Models

[Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction](https://github.com/fzn011/Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction)

Developed a machine learning-based model to predict cardiovascular diseases using data such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Implemented Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Multi-layer Perceptron models to classify patients as healthy or at risk. Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest (98% on training data), and evaluated models using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
